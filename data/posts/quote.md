<p>If ever there was evidence of God, the humble pea is it.</p>
<p>Mother Nature has never created something of such perfection, something that takes Darwin's theory of evolution to the extent that a natural element can, over millions of years, evolve into something so flawless.</p>

It is not an exaggeration to say that peas can be described as nothing
less than perfect spheres of joy.

<p>
The green seed of the white-flowering climbing leguminous papilionaceous
plant, pisum sativum, has become a dining-table favourite for good reason.
</p>
<p>
The perfect accompaniment to any meal, the diminutive spherical vegetable
brings joy to billions worldwide, be they fresh, frozen, canned or dried.
</p>
<p>
Even leaving aside the astounding nutritional package, the taste explosion and
texture of a well cooked pea is undeniably enough to award this deceptively
simple seed the gold-medal of the foodstuff Olympics.
</p>
<p>
There is debate surrounding the tampering of the form of the original
spherical vegetable. The question as to whether the 'mushy' pea is sacrilege
or an innovative approach to re-package the perfect product is a sensitive
issue. A similar argument arises when approaching the relatively new craze of
mangetout. In-depth study is required, but for now it is too early to assess
the true importance of this baby pea pod.
</p>
<p>
In its original form, the pea is a giant amongst food products and a deity of
the vegetable world. It is not an exaggeration to say that peas can be
described as nothing less than perfect spheres of joy.
